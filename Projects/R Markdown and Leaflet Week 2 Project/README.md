### Developing Data Products Week 2 Leaflet Project:

*Author: Alexander M Fisher*  

**********
 
This is the week 2 course project for the Developing Data Products module that is a part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization run by JHU. It is a basic poject that involves exploring a little bit of leaflet. In this repository is a script analysis.R which includes all the code used throughout the Rmarkdown file in a single self contained R file. The final Rmd, and html week_2_leaflet_project files are included. Some data files are also included that can be downloaded using the code provided. Essentially I have retrieved some covid-19 data for England, UK, and generated a map using leaflet. Please feel free to explore the code and the resulting map.
