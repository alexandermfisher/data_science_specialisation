###### Answer:

The goal is for personal understanding

##### Question 3:

Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?

##### Question 10:

If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following is a correct way of doing that?

- Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()
- Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf().
- Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then close the device with dev.off().
- Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, then close the device with dev.off().

###### Answer:
