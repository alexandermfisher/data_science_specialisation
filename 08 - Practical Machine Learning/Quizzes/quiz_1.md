##### Question 1:

Which of the following are components in building a machine learning algorithm?

- Training and test sets
- Statistical inference
- Artificial intelligence
- Machine learning
- Creating features.

###### Answer:

Creating features

##### Question 2:

Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

- We may be using bad variables that don't explain the outcome.v
- We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance.
- We are not asking a relevant question that can be answered with machine learning.
- Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

###### Answer:

Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

##### Question 3:

What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

- 90% training set, 10% test set
- 20% training set, 80% test set.
- 100% training set, 0% test set.
- 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.

###### Answer:

60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set

##### Question 4:

What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)? Check the correct answer(s).

- Correlation
- Median absolute deviation
- Sensitivity
- R^2
- Root mean squared error

###### Answer:

Sensitivity

##### Question 5:

Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

- 9%
- 90%
- 89.9%
- 50%

###### Answer:

9%
