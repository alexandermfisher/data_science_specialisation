### Data Science Capstone:

*Author: Alexander M Fisher*  

**********

This is the final course/module a part of the data science specialization delivered by John Hopkins on Coursera. This module was based around developing an understanding to natural language processing, and ultimately forming our own word prediction algorithm as a shiny app. Included in this repo is the milestone report, the data, the presentation slides, word prediction algorithm scripts, as well as the scripts for the shiny app itself. Please see a list of files included in the next section.

Note to view the app or the milestone report or the slides you can follow the links directly below.
